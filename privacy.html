  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 30th of June 2025</p>

  <p>
    Eevivo ("we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("the App"), available on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When using our App, we may collect the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Email Address</strong> – collected to identify and associate test data with a user account.</li>
    <li><strong>Test Data</strong> – including:
      <ul>
        <li>Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)</li>
        <li>Odometer readings</li>
        <li>Date and time of test</li>
        <li>Battery-related data from the connected vehicle</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is collected only when you actively perform a test using the App and connect to your IoT device over Wi-Fi.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The App requests the <strong>Fine Location (Precise Location)</strong> permission. This is required by the Android operating system in order to detect and connect to Wi-Fi networks (including your IoT device). 
    <strong>We do not access, store, or use your location data in any way.</strong> The permission is requested solely for technical reasons related to how Wi-Fi discovery works on newer versions of Android.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the collected information solely for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To associate test results with the user account</li>
    <li>To display and manage your test history within the app</li>
    <li>To improve your experience and the functionality of the App</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal information or test data with third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    All data collected is securely stored and transmitted using industry-standard encryption methods. 
    We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under 13. 
    If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are made, we will notify users by updating the "Effective Date" above. 
    Continued use of the App after changes have been made indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
  </p>
