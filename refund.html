    Thank you for your purchase from <strong>Eevivo</strong>. Our service provides you with a custom-generated PDF document based on your electric vehicle's data.
  </p>

  <h2>Refund Eligibility</h2>

    <li>You did not receive the file due to a system or delivery issue</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Refund Request Process</h2>
  <p>
    If you believe you're eligible for a refund, please contact us within <strong>7 days</strong> of your purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@eevivo.com">support@eevivo.com</a> with the email you used for purchase and a brief explanation of the issue.
  </p>

  <h2>Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Change of mind after purchase</li>
